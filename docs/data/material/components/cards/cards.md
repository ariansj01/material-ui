# Card

<p class="description">Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}
> For full API and props, see [Card API](/material-ui/api/card/).

## Introduction

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.
The MUI Card component includes several complementary utility components to handle various use cases:

- Card: a container for grouping related content and actions.
- CardContent: the wrapper for the cardâ€™s main content.
- CardHeader: an optional wrapper for the cardâ€™s header area.
- CardMedia: an optional container for images, videos, and other media.
- CardActions: an optional wrapper that groups action buttons.
- CardActionArea: an optional wrapper that makes a defined area of the card interactive.

## Basics

```jsx
import Card from '@mui/material/Card';
import CardContent from '@mui/material/CardContent';
```

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are meant to be entry points to more complex and detailed information.

### Outlined Card

Set `variant="outlined"` to render an outlined card.

{{"demo": "OutlinedCard.js", "bg": true}}

## Complex Interaction

On desktop, card content can expand. (Click the downward chevron to view the recipe.)

{{"demo": "RecipeReviewCard.js", "bg": true}}

## Media

Example of a card using an image to reinforce the content.

{{"demo": "MediaCard.js", "bg": true}}

By default, we use the combination of a `<div>` element and a _background image_ to display the media. It can be problematic in some situations, for example, you might want to display a video or a responsive image. Use the `component` prop for these use cases:

> When using `component="img"`, provide an appropriate `alt` text for accessibility.

{{"demo": "ImgMediaCard.js", "bg": true}}

## Primary action

Often a card allows users to interact with the entirety of its surface to trigger its main action, be it an expansion, a link to another screen, or another behavior. The action area of the card can be specified by wrapping its contents in a `CardActionArea` component.

{{"demo": "ActionAreaCard.js", "bg": true}}

A card can also offer supplemental actions that should be separate from the main action area to avoid event overlap.

{{"demo": "MultiActionAreaCard.js", "bg": true}}

## UI Controls

Supplemental actions within the card are explicitly called out using icons, text, and UI controls, typically placed at the bottom of the card.

Here's an example of a media control card.

{{"demo": "MediaControlCard.js", "bg": true}}

## Active state styles

To customize a Card's styles when it's in an active state, you can attach a `data-active` attribute to the Card Action Area component and apply styles with the `&[data-active]` selector, as shown below:

{{"demo": "SelectActionCard.js", "bg": true}}
